### Development Notes

#### 2024-03-17
- Set up initial Jupyter notebook structure
- Added markdown documentation for:
    - Project overview
    - Data source information
    - Project objectives
    - Step-by-step methodology for data cleaning and EDA

### Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.10.16
- Key packages:
    - pandas (for data manipulation)
    - matplotlib/seaborn (for visualization)
    - scikit-learn (for future modeling)
    - numpy (for numerical operations)

### Best Practices Being Followed
